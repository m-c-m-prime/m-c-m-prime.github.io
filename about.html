            <p>'Purchases and sales are concentrated in his hands and consequently are no longer bound to the direct requirements of the buyer (as merchant). But whatever the social organisation of the spheres of production whose commodity exchange the merchant promotes, his wealth exists always in the form of money, and his money always serves as capital. Its form is always M – C – M'. Money, the independent form of exchange-value, is the point of departure, and increasing the exchange-value an end in itself. Commodity exchange as such and the operations effecting it – separated from production and performed by non-producers – are just a means of increasing wealth, not as mere wealth, but as wealth in its most universal social form, as exchange-value. The compelling motive and determining purpose are the conversion of M into M + ΔM. The transactions M – C and C – M' which promote M – M' appear merely as stages of transition in this conversion of M into M + ΔM.' - Karl Marx, *Das Kapital* Vol. III, p. 223</p>

            <p>'The abstraction within capitalism is the system of feedback (for example, Marx's formula of profit M-C-M') that operates within itself to propel further into expansion; capital sets its own limits while at the same time it is continuously germinating and multiplying: "One sometimes has the impression that flows of capital would willingly dispatch themselves to the moon if the capitalist state were not there to bring them back to earth..." The hyperbole associated with this rocketing effect of capitalism is regulated and maintained through stringent axiomatics that are constantly evolving to accommodate present-day economics. The immanence of axiomatics is presented in *A Thousand Plateaus* as if capitalism would "[...] like us to believe that it confronts the limits of the universe, the extreme limits of resources and energy. But all it confronts are its own limits (the periodic depreciation of existing capital); all it repels and displaces are its own limits (the formation of new capital, in new industries with a high profit rate)."' - Deepak Narang Sawhney, *Axiomatics - The Apparatus of Capitalism*, p. 24</p>

            <p>'In the circulation M-C-M, value suddenly presents itself as a self-moving substance which passes through a process of its own, and for which commodities and money are both mere forms. But there is more to come: instead of simply representing the relations of commodities, it now enters into a private relationship with itself, as it were. It differentiates itself as original value from itself as surplus-value, just as God the Father differentiates himself from himself as God the Son…Value therefore now becomes value in process, money in process, and, as such, capital.' - David Harvey, *A Companion to Marx's Capital*, p. 256</p>

            <p>'Even in its comparatively tame, fully mathematico-scientifically respectable variants, feedback causality tends to auto-production, and thus to time-anomaly. Any nonlinear dynamic process, in direct proportion to its cybernetic intensity, provides the explanation for its own genesis. It appears, asymptotically, to make itself happen. Cybernetic technicity — epitomized by robotic robot-manufacture — includes a trend to autonomization essentially. Pure (or idealized) capitalistic inclination to exponential growth captures the same abstract nonlinear function. Capital, defined with maximum abstraction (in the work of Böhm Bawerk), is circuitous production, in a double, interconnected sense. It takes an indirect, technologically conducted path, routed through enhanced means of production, and it turns back upon itself, regeneratively. As it mechanizes, capital approximates ever more closely to an auto-productive circuit in which it appears – on the screen – as something like the ‘father’ of itself (M → C → M’). There’s no political economy without templexity.' - Nick Land, *Templexity: Disordered Loops Through Shanghai Time*, pp. 40-41</p>
