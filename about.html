            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>The abstraction within capitalism is the system of feedback (for example, Marx's forrmula of profit M-C-M') that operates within itself to propel further into expansion; capital sets its own limits while at the same time it is continuously germinating and multiplying: 'One sometimes has the impression that flows of capital would willingly dispatch themselves to the moon if the capitalist state were not there to bring them back to earth...' The hyperbole associated with this rocketing effect of capitalism is regulated and maintained through stringent axiomatics that are constantly evolving to accomodate present day economics. The immancence of axiomatics is presented in 'A Thousand Plateaus' as if capitalism would '[...] like us to believe that it confronts the limits of the universe, the extreme limits of resouroces and enegy. But all it confronts are its own limits (the perioodic depreciation of existing capital); all it repels and displaces are its own limits (the formuation of new capital, in new industries with a high profit rate).' - Deepak Narang Sawhney, Axiomatics - The Apparatus of Capitalism, p. 24</p>
            <p>'Even in its comparatively tame, fully mathematico- scientifically respectable variants, feedback causality tends to auto-production, and thus to time-anomaly. Any nonlinear dynamic process, in direct proportion to its cybernetic intensity, provides the explanation for its own genesis. It appears, asymptotically, to make itself happen. Cybernetic technicity — epitomized by robotic robot-manufacture — includes a trend to autonomization essentially. Pure (or idealized) capitalistic inclination to exponential growth captures the same abstract nonlinear function. Capital, defined with maximum abstraction (in the work of Böhm Bawerk), is circuitous production, in a double, interconnected sense. It takes an indirect, technologically- conducted path, routed through enhanced means of production, and it turns back upon itself, regeneratively. As it mechanizes, capital approximates ever more closely to an auto-productive circuit in which it appears – on the screen – as something like the ‘father’ of itself (M → C → M’). There’s no political economy without templexity.' - Nick Land - Templexity: Disordered Loops Through Shanghai Time</p>
