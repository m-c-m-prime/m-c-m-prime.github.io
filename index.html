            <p>M-C-M’ (Money-Commodity-Money’ (Prime)) is a positive feedback loop incorporating incorporation as its key component. It is a material-axiomatic system of control dynamics, an unbounded circuit of recursive intensification where capital's alien logic self-amplifies, devouring time, commodities and bodies. Stripping the body of organic limits, this process induces a synthetic transcendentalism, where the noumenal and the virtual converge in a vortex of deterritorialized flows. However, as M-C-M’ contains all socio-economic reproduction, it necessitates an overflow of desire into the system as shockwaves. Accelerated forms of music - jungle, nightcore and a host of increasingly genrebending and genreless dubplates - operate as sonic war machines that compound macro-radical destratification, hacking the temporal fabric and reprogramming cultural vectors towards increasingly decentralized forms of radical organization and resistance. This results in the apocalyptic synthesis of capitalism’s own termination, a fractalized time-space where the linearity of history collapses into an infinite series of destabilizations. As feedback loops spiral beyond critique into the unknown terrain of pure, chaotic potentiality, the universe accelerates towards its own dissolution. M-C-M’ embodies the counteracting tendencies of capital, operating exponentially to sow the seeds for its own hyperstitional apocalypse.</p>
